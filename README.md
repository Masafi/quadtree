# A QuadTree visualization
This is a simple QuadTree algo implementation and visualization.  
Algorithm itself made in abstract way, with using any custom checker (function, that tells for each square does it need to divide).  
Then, I added some functions that gives you more convinient (but less exact) ways to check: by coords, for example.  
And then there is a visualization of the algorithm
